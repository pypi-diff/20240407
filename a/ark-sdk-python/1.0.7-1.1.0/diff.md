 such as MFA How to run: ```shell ark configure ``` The profiles are saved to
 ~/.ark_profiles No arguments are required, and interactive questions will be
 asked If you wish to only supply arguments in a silent fashion, --silent can be
 added along with the arugments Usage: ```shell usage: ark configure [-h] [-r]
